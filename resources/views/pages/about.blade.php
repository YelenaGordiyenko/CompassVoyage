<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>It all started with a bucket list and a strong desire to experience this big beautiful world. I have always been
 a resourceful person and would indulge in research about various things. Also, being a bargain hunter throughout
 life has greatly benefited me in making my travel dreams come true! I’ve planned multiple trips and made them come 
 to life for others. Numerous times I have personally joined groups as a guide throughout the travels – from leading
 them to correct gates at airports (it can be harder than it sounds believe it or not), to figuring out transportation
 at the destination, to acting as a tour guide. I find great joy and pleasure in having the honor of helping people
 experience these highs when they see the world. </p>
